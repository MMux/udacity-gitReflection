When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Not sure yet. Will have to get back on that.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might be working on a feature that would continually cause conflicts if it pulled automatically; this way you can define the unit of work you wish to complete before pulling.
